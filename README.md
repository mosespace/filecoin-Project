## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In today's digital age, storing sensitive documents such as wills, land titles, and other important records can be a challenge. 
The lack of secure and reliable storage solutions has led to many people resorting to keeping physical copies of these documents, which can be lost, damaged, or stolen. 
Additionally, even when stored electronically, these documents are vulnerable to cyberattacks, unauthorized access, and editing by unscrupulous individuals


## SOLUTION
To address this issue, there is a pressing need for a secure and user-friendly app that can store sensitive documents and provide access to only authorized parties (trustees), but does not provide editing rights to them. 
This is especially crucial in cases where the owners of the documents may not be available, incapacitated, or have passed away, and trustees need to access these documents to carry out their responsibilities.

## TREASURE HUB 
TREASURE HUB app enables users to securely store and manage sensitive documents such as wills, land titles, and other important records. 
The app will use state-of-the-art encryption technology (Zero Knowledge Proofs) to ensure that the documents are protected against cyberattacks, and access will be limited to authorized trustees only. 
The app provides no deletion and editing rights, thus, any upload can never be edited, therefore, a user can only upload another version in case of need for changes. This solution would address the current concerns and risks associated with traditional methods of document storage and provide peace of mind to document owners and their trustees.
